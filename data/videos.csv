88,"Dodgers Symphony","The Dodgers Sym-Phony (1998, 30 minutes) presents the story of the legendary Brooklyn Dodgers Sym-Phony Band. Aptly named in 1939 by broadcaster Red Barber, who noted the group's lack of professional musicianship, the Sym-Phony Band was comprised of fans who continued to play in Brooklyn and around the country in tribute to a team that had long since relocated. The film includes interviews with original Sym-Phony bandmembers, such as Jo Jo Delio and many former Brooklyn Dodger ballplayers, including Duke Snider, Carl Erskine, Pee Wee Reese, Ralph Branca, Clem Labine, Johhny Podres, Tommy Lasorda, and Joe Black. Former Giants player Bobby Thomson is also featured.
