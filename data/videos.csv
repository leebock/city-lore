This exhibition celebrates the past and present art of two graffitiartists--Richard Admiral, Jr. and his buddy Lonnie Heller, aka Bama and Pistol--who helped pioneer subway graffiti before the art form was chronicled by acclaimed photographers Henry Chalfant and Martha Cooper in the late '70s.","Urban Folklore","City Lore Gallery","-73.989385","40.723785","Manhattan","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVdo9kM9bhI&list=PL4slyQodoIv19DB472kAEKxUEt_sGsGOK&index=2"

91,"The Mary Mack-a-thon","This Mary Mack-a-thon is an excerpt from Let’s Get the Rhythm, directed by Irene Chagall and coproduced with City Lore and Public Art Films.  The hour-long documentary tells a powerful, engaging, and poignant story about women’s lives by chronicling girls’ handclapping games on inner city playgrounds.  Viewers are introduced to three eight year old girls, Heaven Evans, from a household of four generations of Black women in Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, Eve Cook, from Montclair, New Jersey, and the extraordinarily articulate Sara Wright from East Harlem. The film follows the three girls over a four-year period, showing them learning games, deciding that some of them are “babyish” and eventually outgrowing them.  With scenes of handclapping games played all over the world, the film draws attention to these girls' games as an empowering force in the lives of women.  
<br>
<br>Interwoven with the story of the three central characters growing up, are a series of brilliant and passionate women of all different ages who talk about the role of the games in their lives, among them movement specialist Dionne Kamara, Jawole Willa Jo Zollar, founder of Urban Bush Women, and the prominent folklorist, Bess Lomax Hawes.

107,"Uncle Ng in ""Singing to Remember""","Ng Sheung Chi is known as Ng Bok, or ""Uncle Ng."" He was born in 1910 in China's Tai Shan County, near the Pearl River Delta, where he worked most of his life as a farmer. By the age of 18, Ng was well-known as a Muk'yu singer. 
<br>
<br>Muk'yu, a form of regional Chinese folksongs, has been popular in Tai Shan (Toissan) for over three hundred years. In Muk'yu, people sing about their history and daily life. It has been an essential part of Tai San village culture for centuries. Muk'yu is sung spontaneously by people laboring in the fields, and it is also performed ritually on a stage. There are many different kinds of Muk'yu songs. Some are only a few lines long, while others can take hours, even days, to sing. New songs are written by each generation.
<br>
<br>Ng emigrated to the United States in 1979, where he has revived traditional Muk'yu singing in Chinatown. He can be found at the local senior center singing traditional folksongs while the audience, familiar with the lyrics, often sing along. He can also be found on the streets of Chinatown singing traditional as well as improvisational songs, inventing the lyrics as he sings.

108,"The Amato Opera","Sometimes called a ""mom and pop opera company,"" the Amato stands at the corner of Bowery and Second Street in Manhattan. It held its first performance -- Rossini's Barber of Seville -- in 1948 in the auditorium of Our Lady of Pompeii Church at Bleecker and Carmine. In 1954, they opened with the same opera in their new home at 159 Bleecker Street. The Bleecker Street Theater closed in 1959, and the company performed in different spaces as Sally and Tony planned their next move -- their permanent home at 319 Bowery at Second Street, which opened in 1964.
<br>
<br>In its early days, Sally sustained the company with her lovely lyric soprano -- she then served as the costume designer, known to alter a costume from a size 10 to a size 20 to fit the varied dimensions of their many casts. Tony is the maestro who knows his repertoire of operas almost by heart.
<br>
<br>During the last intermission of every show, Tony addresses the audience and asks them to tell their friends about the Amato Opera, ""for we only advertise through you."" Through word of mouth these ""guardian angels"" of the music have created a community of opera loves (it's believed to be the only self sustaining opera house in the world). ""How do you do it?"" Tony was asked. He answered, ""from one opera to the next.""

126,"Heritage 2 Health - An Introduction","In a novel approach to cultural competency training, the WMC Health Center for Regional Healthcare Innovation along with the Nurse Practitioner Healthcare Foundation and City Lore have developed two unique arts-centered e-Learning courses for improving healthcare providers’ ability to offer culturally sensitive care to diverse populations. Using illustrations from music, sculpture, painting, poetry, dance, hip-hop, and other art forms, and stories from folklorists of varying cultural backgrounds, the courses are designed to raise awareness of the need to employ cultural sensitivity in care delivery, and provide a practical “how to” set of guides. 
<br>
<br>The two courses are fully accredited for CE credit for physicians, physicians assistants, nurse practitioners, and nurses. The courses are designed to meet the learning needs of the entire healthcare team.  
<br>
<br>The program, From Heritage to Health: An Arts Centered Approach to Cultural Competence, includes two e-Learning Courses. The first course focuses on the underlying concepts of culturally sensitive care: cultural humility, knowledge of various cultures, narrative competency, and structural competency or system “savvy.” Concepts are presented in a compelling way, with videoclips, images, and stories designed to enliven and inspire.
<br>
<br>1. Concepts of Culturally Sensitive Care e course:
https://crhi.training.wmchealth.org/c... 
<br>
<br>The second course, Welcoming Patients to Your Practice, highlights the key skills needed to reach out and engage patients in their care in a sensitive manner.  Respect and rapport, eye contact, accepting faith-based beliefs, appropriate touch, active listening, and avoiding ethnocentric responses are all highlighted through the artists’ lenses and works.

135,"Delivery on the C-Train","In 1989, transit worker Joe Caracciolo was on his way to the Rockaways when he heard a woman scream...
<br>
<br>In the late 1980s, not long after City Lore was founded in 1986, we joined forces with the New York City Transit Museum to conduct an oral history of New York City's transit workers. Joe Caracciolo, affectionately known as the ""baby doctor"" after having unexpectedly delivered a baby on the C Train in 1989, was one of the systems greatest raconteurs. His stories are featured in our own publication, ""I've Been Working on the Subway: the Folklore and Oral History of Transit"" (NY Transit Museum, 1991); Robert W. Snyder's ""Transit Talk: New York City's Bus and Subway Workers Tell Their Stories"" (Rutgers U.

He was born on September 16, 1907. When he died at the age of 93, he was considered by many to be the oldest living silent movie piano player. He always insisted to us that he was a ""piano player,"" not a ""pianist."" But, according to his wife, Sylvia Cole, his playing still made ""the girls daffy.""

141,"""Lindy Hop"" at the Savoy","The Savoy Ballroom in Harlem opened on May 12th, 1926, staying open seven nights a week for dancers -- it is said to have held 5,000 dancers on its floor. Actress Lana Turner visited it and called it the ""Home of the Happy Feet"" and that became an unofficial nickname of the dance hall. The Savoy remained an exception in that, during a time when many dance halls were segregated, blacks and whites danced together. The Savoy stayed open until 1958 and the site where it once was now is home to commercial space and apartments.
<br>
<br>The history of the Savoy and the dance called the Lindy Hop are entwined. The Savoy was where the dance originated and where one could see the best dancers of this genre. In 1927, following Charles Lindbergh's first solo transatlantic flight, the pilot was adored in the public eye. After a reference to a ""Lindy's Hop"" at a dance marathon, it's no wonder the name stuck. The Jitterbug is an adaptation of the Lindy Hop, except that it is danced to faster swing music. Sometimes the names of the dances are used interchangeably, but the Lindy Hop is an ""eight count syncopated smooth basic step"" (Ralph Giordana; Social Dancing in America, Volume II, Lindy Hop to Hip Hop, 1901-2000, Greenwood Press, 2007, pg. 92).

143,"A Welsh Tribute to Far Rockaway","Iwan Llwyd writes in Welsh. He was born in Camo, Mid Wales in 1957 and lives in Talybont, near Bangor in the North with his family. He won the Crown at the National Eisteddfod in 1990 with his sequence of poems Gwreichion (Sparks). He has published numerous collections, including Gwasg Taf, which won the Welsh Book of the Year Prize in 1997. ""Far Rockaway"" is published in The Adulterer's Tongue, a parallel-text anthology of work by six Welsh poets (translated and edited by Robert Minhinnick, Carcanet Press, 2003).
<br>
<br>Far Rockaway, Iwan Llwyd
<br>[translated from the Welsh by Robert Minhinnick]
<br>
<br>I will take you to Far Rockaway,
<br>Far Rockaway,
<br>the name strums 
<br>a guitar in my head, sings a choir
<br>of summer and sea-tide rhythms:
<br>talks of lovers over black coffee
<br>on a night-ride in a pick-up truck,
<br>smells of gasoline after rain, 
<br>hand in hand on the trail of the moon,
<br>hunting bullfrogs on a wet lane,
<br>the thrill of that half-remembered tune:
<br>
<br>I will take you to Far Rockaway,
<br>Far Rockaway,
<br>where the heavens' hem
<br>trails in the muddied seashore, 
<br>and trades witty lullabies,
<br>where the graffiti rainbow is a frontier
<br>between the naked walls and the simmering sun,
<br>where the track follows the narrow path
<br>between Saturday's smiles and Sunday's scowl,
<br>as we both share our secret burdens
<br>arm in arm:
<br>
<br>I will take you to Far Rockaway,
<br>Far Rockaway,
<br>where the city police
<br>are sketching poems as they await the train,
<br>and swap stories with their submachine guns,
<br>and the poets on their high rise ladders
<br>are daubing cynghanedd on four walls,
<br>drinking whisky and dew,
<br>playing left-handed chess;
<br>the name is one long drawn out kiss--
<br>Far Rockaway, Far Rockaway.
<br>
<br>""It was 1994 and my first ever visit to the US of A. As the plane crossed the Atlantic coast the pilot announced that we were entering the US so many thousand feet 'above Bangor, Maine.' I had started my journey in Bangor, North Wales, and there was some kind of strange synchronicity in his announcement.
<br>
<br>I was in the US to film a series of poetry based programmes giving my first impressions of the States for the Welsh language TV channel, S4C, and was meeting the camera crew at JFK airport. From there we had planned to take a train to Manhattan. Due to some confusion however, we caught the 'A' train and found ourselves in a place called Far Rockaway in Queens. Despite being by the sea, Far Rockaway had obviously seen better days. From its heyday before World War II, air-conditioning and air travel led to a rapid decline, and half a century later it hit rock bottom, with high crime, crazy urban renewal schemes and the shutdown of a Long Island Rail Road train stop.
<br>
<br>The beach was littered with debris and pollution, graffiti coloured the main street buildings and the cops paraded not in pairs but in posses, and we caught the first train out of Far Rockaway back to the relative safety of Manhattan. However, I couldn't escape from that haunting name -- Far Rockaway. An earlier Welsh poet, T H Parry-Williams, sang of the magic in the name Santa Fe, and the name Far Rockaway gave me a similar frisson. The poem recalls many aspects of my time in the US, but also goes into the realm of lullabies and romance, all inspired by the singalong sound of the name, Far Rockaway.
<br>
<br>Since my brief time in Far Rockaway, I have been made aware that many other poets have been inspired by the name -- as diverse as Miroslav Holub, Delmore Schwartz and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, who echoes my misdirected train ride to Far Rockaway:
<br>
<br>'I still would love to find again
<br>
<br>that lost locality
<br>
<br>Where I might catch once more
<br>
<br>a Sunday subway for
<br>
<br>some Far Rockaway of the heart'.""
